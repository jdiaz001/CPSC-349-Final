                     <h2 class="mb-3">Description</h2>
                     <p>Galaga is famous for enemies' dramatic entrance. The enemies swoop in from off screen along paths that curve and 
                        circle on screen then disappear off screen. The aliens return on screen and create a grid-like pattern at the top 
                        of the screen facing off against the player. Regularly, groups of enemies dive towards the player and shoot. 
                        The goal of the game is to score the highest score possible before losing all three lives. If the player defeats 
                        all the enemies in a given scene, then the scene is completed and a new scene begins with new enemies.

                     <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Challenges</h2>
                     <ol>
                        <li>Challenge: Establishing a functional Pygame application with different game states (screens).<br><br>
                            Solution: Set up the main game loop, Pygame initialization, and display in galaga.py.
                            Implemented a scene management system with a base Scene class and a SceneManager class (scene.py, scenemanager.py) 
                            to handle transitions between TitleScene, GameScene, GameOverScene, and LeaderboardScene.
                            Centralized game assets (colors, sound paths, music paths) in galaga_asset_dict.py for easy management.<br><br>
                        </li>

                        <li>Challenge: Creating an interactive player character with movement, shooting, and a life system.<br><br>
                            Solution: Developed a Player class with attributes for position, speed, and lives. Implemented movement logic
                            controlled by arrow keys. Added a shooting mechanism, creating bullet objects managed in game.py
                            Designed a triangular player ship rendered with pygame.draw.polygon. Created a visual death animation 
                            and a respawn sequence upon losing a life.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Challenge: Robustness of file I/O for the leaderboard.<br><br>
                            Solution: Enhanced _load_scores methods in GameOverScene and LeaderboardScene with comprehensive try-except blocks 
                            to handle potential issues like FileNotFoundError, EOFError, pickle.UnpicklingError, and ValueError, preventing 
                            crashes and ensuring smoother user experience even if the save file was problematic. Added validation for score 
                            entry format during rendering.
                        </li>
                     </ol>
                     <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Outcomes</h2>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Successfully built a Pygame application with a clear, modular structure. This includes a main game loop 
                            (galaga.py), a centralized asset dictionary (galaga_asset_dict.py), and a scene management system 
                            (scene.py, scenemanager.py). This system now effectively manages transitions between different game states: 
                            the Title screen, the main Game screen, the Game Over screen, and a Leaderboard.</li>
                        <li>A fully functional player (player.py) was created. The player ship can be controlled, can shoot projectiles, 
                            has a limited number of lives, and displays a distinct death animation sequence before respawning.</li>
                        <li>Developed an Enemy class and an EnemyManager (enemy.py, enemymanager.py) that bring diverse enemy actions to life. 
                            Enemies now perform an initial "parade" movement into formation, hold their positions, execute various diving attack 
                            patterns (linear, wave, targeting the player), shoot at the player, and have their own death animations.</li>
                        <li>A complete leaderboard system was implemented. The GameOverScene now prompts players to enter their name if 
                            they achieve a high score, and these scores (name, date, score) are saved to a file (leaderboard.pkl). The 
                            LeaderboardScene loads and displays these top scores. Robust error handling was added to manage potential issues with 
                            the leaderboard file (e.g., if it's missing or corrupted), preventing game crashes.</li>
